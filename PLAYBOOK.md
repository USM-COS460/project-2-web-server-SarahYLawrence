## My experience with this project
Brief summary of your experience with the project and what was learned.

Overall, I learned how to parse a request and how to respond to it. The request was parsed by the command GET and by the file path (ex,/pub/WWW/index.html). The response used the file path to then give the appropriate header. If the path was there, return a 200 header; else, return a 404 header. This then sent the header and the file contents to the HTTP server. 

It's silly, but I learned that formatting is very important. In response_codes for the headers, I didn't have \r\n to help go to the start of the next line. I only had \n. This messed with the site's formatting and made it so images wouldn't work at all. I fixed this, and the formatting was fixed. I then tested the site on Safari, and it broke due to a similar formatting error. Something fun I learned was that the request had the file path it wanted in it. I didn't understand it at first, but after this, I thought it was cool.
